# flight-delay-prediction

This study analyzes high-dimensional data from  US Airports and presents a practical flight delay prediction model. Following a multifactor approach, a novel deep belief network method is employed to mine the inner patterns of flight delays. Support vector regression is embedded in the developed model to perform a supervised fine-tuning within the presented predictive architecture. The proposed method has proven to be highly capable of handling the challenges of large datasets and capturing the key factors influencing delays.

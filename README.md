# flight-delay-prediction

This study analyzes high-dimensional data from  US Airports and presents a practical flight delay prediction model. Following a multifactor approach, a novel deep belief network method is employed to mine the inner patterns of flight delays. Support vector regression is embedded in the developed model to perform a supervised fine-tuning within the presented predictive architecture. The proposed method has proven to be highly capable of handling the challenges of large datasets and capturing the key factors influencing delays.

Machine Learning Algorithms to Predict delays :  

1) Random Forest: used to predict whether a flight will be delayed or not 

2) Ridge Regression to see how many minutes a particular flight will be delayed
